    <para>
      Podcasting
      is a method of publishing radio-like programs on the
      Internet.  Through podcasting, almost anyone can produce their
      own audio program, and publish episodes of it as often or as
      rarely as they like.
    </para>

    <para>
      To listen to podcasts, you need a program to download the
      podcast's episodes from the Internet.  Such a program is
      called a podcatcher (or sometimes a podcast aggregator).
      &hpodder; is this program.

    <refsect2 id="hpodder.mo">
      <title>Method of Operation</title>
      <para>
        The basic pattern of operation with &hpodder; is to set up
        each podcast you want to receive.  Each day (or hour, or
        whatever), &hpodder; will go out and update its database by
        pulling in the latest episode lists from the podcast feed.
        Then, &hpodder; will proceed to download any episodes that
        you haven't already downloaded.  After each episode is
        downloaded, &hpodder; will note that fact so it isn't ever
        downloaded again.
      </para>
      <para>
        Let's look at this in a bit more detail.
      </para>
      <para>
        &hpodder; maintains two tables in a database.  One table
        lists all the podcasts you know about, as well as where the
        podcast's feed is to be downloaded from.  The feed is a file
        that the podcast's author publishes.  It lists all the
        current episodes of the podcast, and some information about
        them.  Data is added to this table with the <command>hpodder
          add</command> command.
      </para>
      <para>
        The second table lists each episode for a given podcast,
        along with the location from which the episode can be
        downloaded and some other information about the episode
        (such as its title).  Information in this table is added by
        <command>hpodder update</command> and updated by
        <command>hpodder download</command> or 
        <command>hpodder catchup</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you first fire up &hpodder;, it will read its
        configuration file from
        <filename>~/.hpodder/hpodder.conf</filename>.
        What happens next depends on the command.
      </para>
      <para>
        For <command>hpodder update</command>, the program will read
        information about all your podcasts.  It will download each
        feed.  Once it has the feed, it will look at each episode
        and compare them to the database.  If a given episode is
        already in the database, it is ignored.  Any new episodes
        are recorded in the database, and set to Pending so they
        will be downloaded on the next download run.
      </para>
      <para>
        For <command>hpodder download</command>, the program will
        read information about all your episodes.  For each episode
        marked Pending, the program will download the episode.  It
        will then update the episode's ID3 tags based on the podcast
        feed.  Finally, it will move the episode in-place
        atomically.  Only after all that has been done will
        &hpodder; mark the episode as Downloaded in the database.
        In this way, no episode is visible to outside tools until it
        is completely downloaded in its final form, so you can
        safely play any visible program in your download directory
        even as downloads are happening.
      </para>

  <refsect1 id="hpodder.quickstart">
    <title>Quick Start</title>
    <para>
      This section will describe how a first-time &hpodder; user can
      get up and running quickly.  It assumes you already have
      &hpodder; compiled or installed on your system.  If not,
      please follow the instructions in the
      <filename>INSTALL</filename>
      file in the
      source distribution.
    </para>
    <para>
      To get started, simply run <command>hpodder</command> at your
      shell prompt.  &hpodder; will lead you through the first-time
      configuration -- which is only two questions and completely
      self-explanatory!
    </para>
    <para>
      After this, whenever you want to download the latest episodes
      for your podcast, just run <command>hpodder</command> again.
    </para>
    <para>
      At some point, you'll want to add more podcasts to &hpodder;.
      To do that, just run a command such as:
    </para>
    <para><command>hpodder add
        <replaceable>http://www.example.com/feed.xml</replaceable></command></para>
    <para>
      Just replace the example.com URL here with the real URL of the
      feed you want to add.  Then run <command>hpodder
        update</command>.  If the podcast you've just added has a
      whole bunch of episodes, you may not want to download them
      all.  In that case, run <command>hpodder catchup
        <replaceable>id</replaceable></command>, where
      <replaceable>id</replaceable> is the podcast number that
      &hpodder; gave your new podcast when you added it.
    </para>
    <para>
      Again, from here on, you can just run
      <command>hpodder</command> to download all your new episodes.

        Sometimes the XML feed for the podcast may not provide a
        useful title.  In those situations, you can use

        database of episodes.  For any episode mentioned in the feed
        that is not already in the internal database of episodes,
        &hpodder; will add it to its database and set its status to
        Pending.

    <title>Specifying podcast IDs</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Podcasts</><secondary>IDs</></>
    <para>
      Each podcast in &hpodder; gets a numeric ID.  This ID is
      automatically assigned by &hpodder; and is not changable.  The
      ID is given out when a podcast is added with the
      <command>add</command> command, or with the
      <command>lscasts</command> or <command>lsepisodes</command>
      commands.
    </para>
    <para>
      The ID is designed as a constant way to refer to a particular
      podcast.  A podcast's title may change, or even its feed URL,
      but the ID of a podcast will never change.  It also is short and
      easy to type on the command line.
    </para>
    <para>
      Several commands can take a list of podcast IDs.  If no IDs are
      given, the commands will default to operating on all podcasts.
      One or more IDs can be given, separated by spaces.  If IDs are
      given, then the commands will operate only on the podcasts with
      the given IDs.
    </para>
    <para>
      The special keyword <option>all</option> may be given, which
      tells the system to operate on all podcasts.  This yields the
      same result as giving no IDs at all.

    <title>Automatic Error Handling</title>
    <para>
      For whatever reason, podcast feeds or individual episodes sometimes
      fail to download.  The reasons for this range from the podcast being
      taken down by its author to the network being disconnected from the
      local computer.
    </para>
    <para>
      People that track many podcasts over a long time will probably find it
      annoying to have &hpodder; attempt to download invalid feeds or
      episodes over and over again.  For that reason, &hpodder; 1.0.0
      introduced automatic error handling.
    </para>
    <para>
      Once a podcast feed or episode has failed at least 15 times, 
      it's been at least 21 days since the first download attempt (episodes)
      or last update (feeds), &hpodder; will automatically mark the item to
      be skipped in future runs.  For podcast feeds, &hpodder; disabled the
      podcast; this status will appear in <command>hpodder lscasts</>.
      For episodes, &hpodder; sets the status to Error; this will appear
      in <command>hpodder lseps</>.  Both can be changed later, with
      <command>hpodder enable</> or <command>hpodder setstatus</>,
      respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
      The default minimums of 15 attempts and 21 days may be adjusted in
      the &hpodder; configuration file, either globally or on a per-podcast
      basis.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you wish to disable checking entirely, you can put lines such as
      <literal>epfaildays = 123456789</literal> and
      <literal>podcastfaildays = 123456789</literal> in your <literal>DEFAULT</>
      section in <filename>~/.hpodder/hpodder.conf</>.  Of course, if you
      have podcasts that still fail after 338,237 years, you could be in

      In this example, you saw some "general" options, such as

    <para>
      Whenever &hpodder; looks for information about a particular
      podcast, it first checks to see if it can find that option in a

      answer, it consults its built-in defaults.

                file, based on the on-disk content.  If this command exits
                with an error, the MIME type given in the podcast feed will
                be used.  If you want to always use the MIME type in the
                podcast feed, you can set this to
                <literal>/bin/false</literal> or the empty string.

                It is expected that this program will write its result
                to standard output.  The first token of the output is
                taken to be the MIME type.  The remainder will be
                discarded.  For instance, for the output
                <literal>text/x-pascal; charset=us-ascii</literal>,
                the type will be taken to be
                <literal>text/x-pascal</literal>.  If the program
                exits with a nonzero exit code, its output will not be used.

                Each entry in the list in a MIME type, a colon, and

    <title>Curl Configuration File</title>
    <para>
      Internally, &hpodder; uses the Curl application to perform
      downloads across the Internet.  Curl is a remarkably flexible
      application, and &hpodder; takes advantage of that to provide
      you with quite a few options.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can customize Curl as much as you like by creating a Curl
      configuration file in <filename>~/.hpodder/curlrc</filename>.
      Please see <application>curl</application>(1) for more details
      on the content of that file.
    </para>
    <para>Some things you can do with this file include restricting
    the maximum download rate, suppressing or adjusting the progress
    meter, configuring proxies, etc.

      <title>Going Through a Proxy</title>
      <indexterm><primary>Proxy</><secondary>Using with hpodder</></>
      <para>
        If your connections must go through a proxy, you have two
        options: set an environment varilable or configure the proxy
        in your <filename>~/.hpodder/curlrc</filename>.  If you use an
        environment variable, your settings will also impact other
        applications -- and that's probably what you want.  See the
        Environment section later for tips on doing that.

      <title>Limiting Your Download Speed</title>
      <indexterm><primary>Download Rate</><secondary>Limiting</></>
      <para>
        Sometimes, you may not want &hpodder; to use all of your
        available bandwidth.  Perhaps you don't want it to slow down
        other activities too much.  To do this, just create a
        <filename>~/.hpodder/curlrc</filename> file.  Put in it
        something like this:
      </para>
      <programlisting>limit-rate=20k</programlisting>
      <para>
        This will limit the download rate to 20 KB/sec.
      </para>
      <para>
        This rate limitation is imperfect and may not do well during
        <command>update</command>, but it should do exactly what you
        want during <command>download</command>.

    <para>
      &hpodder; does not read any environment variables directly.
      However, it does pass on the environment to the
      programs it calls, such as Curl.  This can be useful for
      specifying proxies.  Please see
      <application>curl</application>(1) for more details.
      As specified in the Per-Podcast Command Options section, &hpodder;
      will also set certain variables for post-processing of
      downloaded files.
